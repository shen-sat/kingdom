Scoping:
- create floor
- ensure player can move along floor
- generesize this so any sprite is automatically placed on floor

Done:
- create map green
- create map blue
- create player
- spawn player near right border
- create player movement
- logic - when player is in map green and goes past x then map changes to blue and vice versa
- create rabbit
- spawn rabbit near left border
- create rabbit always right movement
- logic - same as player's
- check that rabbit updates green map position when player on blue screen and vice versa (once rabbit moves into blue screen)
