Scoping:
- add random movement to civs once reached camp_fire
- add another civ
- when arrow is bought, rush civs to archery_shop
- first civ to archery_shop gets promoted to hunter  


Done:
- create map green
- create map blue
- create player
- spawn player near right border
- create player movement
- logic - when player is in map green and goes past x then map changes to blue and vice versa
- create rabbit
- spawn rabbit near left border
- create rabbit always right movement
- logic - same as player's
- check that rabbit updates green map position when player on blue screen and vice versa (once rabbit moves into blue screen)
- create floor
- ensure player can move along floor
- generate coins if camp fire and player overlap and X is pressed and held
- only allow a coin to generate IF king can afford it
- populate cost if X is held
- create a cost for campfire
- -= cost if x is held when overlapping with camp_fire (in same code that generates coin to spend)
- once cost = 0 for campfire, wait one sec then: 
	- change camp_fire sprite
	- remove coin and cost slot
- if camp_fire bought then level 1 reached
- if level one reached then spawn archery shop
- if overlap with archery_shop, show cost
- if X is pressed then buy arrow
	- generesice arrows to products
	- if an items has products then draw those products (the resposnibility of drawing those products should be with the shop)
- refactor to draw and update all buyable objects
- draw peasants
- draw civilian
- change level 1 to incude adding a peasnt object to buyable objects
- see if you can see cost and buy peasant
- upon bought, peasnt should turn into civ
- upon bought civ should head to campfire
