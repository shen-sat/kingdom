Scoping:
- create a cost for campfire
- -= cost if x is held when overlapping with camp_fire (in same code that generates coin to spend)
- once cost = 0 for campfire, wait one sec then: 
	- change camp_fire sprite
	- remove coin and cost slot


Done:
- create map green
- create map blue
- create player
- spawn player near right border
- create player movement
- logic - when player is in map green and goes past x then map changes to blue and vice versa
- create rabbit
- spawn rabbit near left border
- create rabbit always right movement
- logic - same as player's
- check that rabbit updates green map position when player on blue screen and vice versa (once rabbit moves into blue screen)
- create floor
- ensure player can move along floor
- generate coins if camp fire and player overlap and X is pressed and held
- only allow a coin to generate IF king can afford it
- populate cost if X is held
